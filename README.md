# What is this repo about?
In this repository, we are trying to collect the most used good naming for methods, variables, and classes that many developers are using to make their code more readable and meaningful. 

We have started the journey with verbs. We will be happy to ask the developers and engineers community to move the repository forwards as there might be many mindsets and visions about better naming conventions that will be covered as we have more contributor

# What is the goal?
We are trying to make life easier so our goal is to make a referenceable database that developers are free to use it for their development and implementation under license of MIT.
Also, this database will be used to make a plugin for developers IDE to predict and/or recommend names to make. we will publish this plugin after we reach a bunch of good records of data at each of our branches.

# How to contribute 
At this step, we have only a branch named verbs. that contains a table of meaningful and strong names for functions. we are planning to continue the journey for noun adjective and full collocation for naming as well in near future.

By the moment feel free to open a pull request for the "Verb" branch and let us know about verbs that you think are useful for others as well.

To make a life for contributor easier we have a list of predefined issues that are accessible through the "issues" tab. Choose the verb that you may think you have a good idea about how to explain it understandable for others as well.
